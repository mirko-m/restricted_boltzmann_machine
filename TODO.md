- [ ] Implement pseudo-log-likelihood for numpy and tensorflow code.
- [ ] Implement summary of weights and biases for tensorflow.
- [ ] Implement some way of saving and loading a fitted RBM for tensorflow.
- [ ] Create notebook for full MNIST data set using tensorflow.
- [ ] The functions for loading the MNIST data are quite slow. Maybe I can improve
  this.
- [ ] Have a look at other data sets.
- [ ] Implement RBMS where the visible unit is not necessarily binary.
