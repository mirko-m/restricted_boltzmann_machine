This repository contains code for an implementation of a binary Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBM) using both numpy and tensorflow. The models are trained
using k-contrastive-divergence or k-persistent-contrastive-divergence. A
discussion of these algorithms can be found in A. Fischer and C. Igel, _Training
restricted Boltzmann machines\: An Introduction_, Pattern Recognition **47** ,
25 (2014).

Some jupyter notebooks which train the models on the MNIST data set
(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) are also provided.
